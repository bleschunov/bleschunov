I found out about web technologies when I was about 12. I have come back to this from time to time. I have tried
to make a landing page for my mates, application with backend on PHP and even site layout for money. I liked it. So, after I had been graduated from
school I decided to become a professional web developer. 

I have been finished a course about JavaScript and React. Course project is [here](https://github.com/bleschunov/marvel). Well, now I am looking for a
job or projects to improve my skills.
